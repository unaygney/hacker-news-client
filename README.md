# Hacker News Client Project

ðŸš€ **Completed the Hacker News Client Project!**

I developed a _Hacker News Client_ as part of the **Greatfrontend challenge**
using **React**, **Next.js**, and **TanStack Query**. The site allows you to
view real news and content, and you can even browse job postings as well. I
optimized the data fetching processes to provide a dynamic user experience and
built reusable components. The stack also includes **TailwindCSS** for styling,
which helped me ensure a responsive and visually appealing interface.

### Tech Stack:

- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: To handle both server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TanStack Query**: For managing and caching server-state.
- **TailwindCSS**: For easy and responsive UI styling.

### How to Set Up the Project:

   ```bash
